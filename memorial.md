Immediately following the service, a slide show was shared.

Due to copyright restrictions, the audio we played during Elsie's memorial
cannot be included in a video uploaded to YouTube. We are working on finding an
alternate solution to serve the video and audio together, but in the mean-time
above is a no-audio version. The playlist we used was:

 - The Last Waltz - Engelbert Humperdinck
 - You Belong to Me - Jo Stafford
 - Cry - Johnnie Ray
 - Wheel of Fortune - Kay Starr
 - Blue Tango - Leroy Anderson
 - What a Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong

<br />
The photos in the slide-show and more are available in Ross' ['_ElsieJohnson_' Album on Google Photos](http://bit.ly/remembering-elsie-album){:target="_blank"}, which many family members have contributed to. Family and friends are encouraged to continue adding photos.

The playlist for the slide-show was derrived from Tommy's ['_Grandma and Grandpa 1952_' playlist on Spotify](http://bit.ly/remembering-elsie-playlist){:target="_blank"}, with additional input from Lisa.
