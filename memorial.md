# Elsie's Memorial Service

A memorial service was held on Sunday February 21, 2021. 

The service's program can be downloaded [HERE](/RememberingElsie.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Recording

The service was held via Zoom, and we were able to capture a recording:

## Slide Show

Immediately following the service, a slide show was shared.

Due to copyright restrictions, the audio we played during Elsie's memorial
cannot be included in a video uploaded to YouTube.

We are working on finding an alternate solution, but in the mean-time here
is a no-audio version. The playlist we used was:

 - The Last Waltz - Engelbert Humperdinck
 - You Belong to Me - Jo Stafford
 - Cry - Johnnie Ray
 - Wheel of Fortune - Kay Starr
 - Blue Tango - Leroy Anderson
 - What a Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong
