  <div class="article">
    <p>When I was growing up, my parents, Del and Elsie, loved going going to the beach. Seaside, Cannon Beach, Tolovana, Ecola State Park, The Three Capes, Manzanita to see Uncle Walt, Aunt June and three of our many cousin, Tillamook and the Cheese Factory when they had walking tours on the factory floor and many other beaches but my favorite was going to Rockaway.</p>

<p>I remember staying at my Uncle Al’s cabin once when I was very little in Rockaway. We were getting ready to go somewhere and my brother Danny and I were already in the car. I was in the backseat and Danny took the emergency break off and we started slowly rolling back. I remember the look on my Dad’s face as he ran to stop the car and I don’t think I have ever seen such a look of panic on my Mom’s face. If my Dad hadn’t stopped us going back down a hill, over the railroad tracks, across the highway and there is also a lake. No wonder she looked so panicked!</p>

<p>Most of the time, I had wonderful memories of Rockaway and it was a favorite place for my parents to go—they bought three weeks at Rockaway Beach Resort from my sister Teresa and when they were there, they would spend time with my mom’s sister—my Aunt Patsy and Uncle Frank and my Dad’s brother Al—Uncle Al and Aunt Pat—they all loved Rockaway so much they lived there.</p>

<p>Not only did my parents go to Rockaway with their kids, they also had grandkids go there. After my Dad passed away, I took my Mom there many times and I bought the time share from them and some of my grands, which would be Del and Elsie’s great-grands have enjoyed Rockaway.</p>
