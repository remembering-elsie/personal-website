    <p>Summertime on the back porch. Dominos Pizza, Coca Cola, chopped carrots, the smell of Grandma’s tomatoes still on the vine, and climbing their maple tree and 10’ chain link fence.  That is how to spend a summer afternoon.</p>

<p>I remember visiting with Grandma after Grandpa Del passed away, and we went to Willamette National Cemetary, the grounds keepers were actively burying Grandpa’s ashes.  She didn’t like the spot, and we approached them and she pointed to a higher spot which had a view of the mountain.  After some deliberation, they relented and  actually agreed to bury him at the new plot, which has a spectacular view.</p>

<p>Grandma and Grandpa would visit us in Corvallis, and when they left in their blue car she would wave out the window all the way down the street and around the corner we never saw her stop.  I smile to think of her still waving, and Grandma- I love you and am waving back in my heart.</p>
