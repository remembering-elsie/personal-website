I remember one time coming home for a visit in the late ’90s, so it was our old family house on 71st Avenue.  And on the refrigerator there were some drawings by children, with names on them that I didn’t recognize.  And there were a couple of photos of Mom with young children, probably 6 or 7 years old.  I asked Mom about them, and Mom told me that she had become a volunteer tutor for young kids at the grade school next door to the house, the grade school we all attended.  Mom had quietly taken on this volunteer work and was helping them with their reading skills.  The kids had given her the drawings and written thank you notes.  It reminded me of the way that she would read with us when we were little and just learning to read.
