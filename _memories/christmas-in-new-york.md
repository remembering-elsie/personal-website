Christmas of 2014 was a very special time. Just to do something different, instead of staying in Oregon for the holiday, Mom flew to New York and stayed with Hector and me at our house in Jersey City. Our brother Bill lives just across the river in New York City, so he was with us too. She really enjoyed the visit, even we live in a tall and narrow townhouse, and the guest room is up 3 flights of stairs. Some of the pictures in the slideshow are from that Christmas. Itâ€™s a sweet memory because it was the last time Mom was able to travel across the country. Just a few weeks later she had her bad fall at home that led to her moving into Cherrywood.
