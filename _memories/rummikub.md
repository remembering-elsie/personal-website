A few years back, I took my then boyfriend, now husband, Patrick, to Cherrywood to meet Grandma. It was summertime, so we hung out in the garden for a bit, and then had milkshakes at the Cherrywood ice cream shop. Grandma was friendly, and asked Patrick lots of questions. But, I could tell she was trying to check out my new boyfriend to make sure that she could give her Grandma seal of approval. After our milkshakes she invited us up to the game room. That’s when she laid the hammer down. She beat us in Rummikub not once, not twice, but three times in a row! I’ll never forget it. She was in her mid-eighties, but sharp as a tack and as competitive as ever. It was so much fun, and her Rummikub skills were really top notch!
