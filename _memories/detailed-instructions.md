My Mom had seven children, all of them reaching adulthood. Imagine her reaction when she saw the very detailed instructions I  wrote for how to take care of 18 month old Tommy while I was in the hospital giving birth to his brother,Steve.

She didnâ€™t say anything at the time, but nearly 13 years later, she sent me a copy.

Evidently, she still thought it was funny.
